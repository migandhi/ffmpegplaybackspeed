# Video Speed Adjustment Batch Script

This batch file allows you to adjust the speed of a segment of a video file. It uses FFmpeg to perform the following tasks:

1. **Extracts** a segment of the video based on specified start and end times.
2. **Adjusts** the speed of the video and audio within that segment.
3. **Concatenates** the adjusted segment with the parts of the video before and after the segment.

## Usage

```sh
batch_file.bat video_file start_time end_time output_file speed_factor

Parameters:

    video_file: The path to the input video file.
    start_time: The start time of the segment to be adjusted (format: HH:MM:SS).
    end_time: The end time of the segment to be adjusted (format: HH:MM:SS).
    output_file: The name of the output video file with speed adjustments.
    speed_factor: The factor by which to adjust the speed. Valid values are:
        To speed up: 2, 4, or 8
        To slow down: 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125

Examples:

Speed up a video segment:

batch_file.bat "comfyavatar.mp4" "00:00:07" "00:00:57" "testoutput1754.mp4" 8

Slow down a video segment:

batch_file.bat "comfyavatar.mp4" "00:00:07" "00:00:57" "testoutput1754.mp4" 0.25

How It Works

    Extracts Segment: Uses FFmpeg to extract the segment of the video between start_time and end_time.
    Adjusts Speed:
        Adjusts video speed using setpts filter.
        Adjusts audio speed using atempo filter.
    Cuts Before/After: If valid, it cuts parts of the video before and after the segment.
    Concatenates: Creates an input.txt file for FFmpeg to concatenate the original video parts with the adjusted segment.
    Cleans Up: Deletes temporary files created during processing.

Requirements

    FFmpeg: Make sure you have FFmpeg installed and the path set correctly in the batch file (ffmpeg_path variable).
    Windows: This script is designed to run on Windows operating systems.

Notes

    Ensure that the FFmpeg executable path in the batch file is correctly set to your FFmpeg installation.
    If the start_time or end_time is zero or invalid, the corresponding video parts may be skipped.

Troubleshooting

    Invalid Speed Factor: Make sure to use one of the valid speed factors listed above.
    Errors with FFmpeg Path: Verify the ffmpeg_path variable points to the correct FFmpeg executable.
